Our studio brief is to follow the principles of ability-based design, such that users should not have to adapt their abilities to technology. With most contemporary pathfinding applications, the objective is focused on direct, fast access from one place to the next; however, if the user wishes to explore the area, make detours, or follow paths that meet their preferences (which are not efficiency or speed), then that typically requires extra steps that the app is not primarily aimed to satisfy. Our app makes sure the technology adapts to the abilities of the user, and what route preferences they both want and need.

## Notice
This is a class project for COGS 120: Interaction Design, Winter 2018 Quarter at UCSD. This is intended as a front-end project suited for a mobile device. All back-end stuff is mocked and hard-coded to simulate a Wizard-of-Oz experiment. There might be a possibility that I return to this and add complete back-end logic.
